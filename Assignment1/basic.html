<h1>Why i joined AltSchoolAfrica?</h1>
<p>
I joined AltSchoolAfrica to enhance and hone my tech skills as i already have prior knowledge.We have a community 
used to pass informations,announcements,questions and interactions among students. 
The basic tools used for coding is the VSCODE where editing and coding takes place.We also make use of 
slack for announcements and general informations.
Learning tech has not been easy but it's just the beginning at AltschoolAfrica and i am leaning in.I joined this 
institute based on the feedbacks i got from other devs who have passed through not limited to SOE.I look forward to 
getting the best knowledge and skills too.
